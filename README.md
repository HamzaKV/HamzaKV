### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Web3 real estate fintech platform to lower the boundaries of investing in real estate
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning on implementing engineering design principles to my tech stacks to improve DX and code maintainability
- ðŸš€ I have recently released two react libraries, react-web-worker-hooks and grams. Both are exciting personal projects.
- ðŸŽ‰ Released an extension integrating my favourite code editor and secrets manager: [Doppler extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HamzaKV.doppler-extension)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love reading books - my favourites include Harry Potter, LOTR, Percy Jackson, Alex Cross, Robert Langdon and Jack Reacher!
